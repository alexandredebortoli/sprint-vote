## Setup and Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following tools installed:

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (recommended version 16 or greater)
-   [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Running the Application

To run the application, you'll need to set up and run both the API and the app components. The API is built with NestJS and TypeScript, serving as the backend, while the app is a React Native Expo project for the frontend.

### Running the API (Backend)

1. **Navigate to the API Directory**

Open your terminal and from the root directory navigate to the `server` directory.

```bash
cd server
```

2. **Install Dependencies**

Install the required dependencies for the server application.

```bash
yarn
```

3. **Set Up the Database**

While still in the `server` directory, start the PostgreSQL database in a Docker container.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

4. **Start the API**

To start the API in development mode, run:

```bash
yarn start:dev
```

The API should now be running on the specified port.

> The default port is 3333

### Running the App (Frontend)

1. **Navigate to the App Directory**

Open a new terminal window and from the root directory navigate to the `client` directory.

```bash
cd client
```

2. **Install Dependencies**

Install the required dependencies for the React Native Expo app.

```bash
yarn
```

3. **Start the App**

To start the app, run:

```bash
yarn start
```

This will launch the development server and provide options to visualize the app using Expo Go on a mobile device or an emulator/simulator.

You should now have both the API and the app up and running, allowing you to interact with the application.
